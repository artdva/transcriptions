00:09,HS,"Awesome. Do you guys want to start with the first proposal? The, the children's during the COVID? Yeah. Okay. Does anyone want to start with that?",instructional
00:29,CS,"I thought I thought it was a novel idea. Especially for very young children. I was looking, I was trying to see there's an age range in the paper. But yeah, um, if I think for...Yeah, I think it's a very novel idea. I think. If it can give some comfort to young children who maybe attention or relationship starved, I think it could benefit both them and future children. Through the study, I think the only thing that jumped out at me when I was reading the just the brief summary, and also the paper, abstract is just...privacy and how the data is, is it all like machine learning on the toy? If that's the case, then I have no problems. But if it's being... Yeah, I just have concerns about the data being used, collected from the children. Oh, it's only five children that..Oh, that's right. Yeah. What do you guys think?",influentiality;privacy
01:46,SC,"I also agree with like, the privacy just because the preset, like record, like conversations and. And like, I didn't really read in depth to the paper. But yeah, just recordings in general.",privacy
02:02,HS,"Yeah, I don't know, if it's the it's sort of a potentially good solution. But I think the best solution would be, ideally, for them to just have more like, say, to have like online learning. And also, hopefully, their parents can provide them with like social time with other children, that sort of sort of supplement or even the adults that can sort of supplement their effectiveness class and stuff like that. I'm just sort of, I don't really think that it's the best solution to the problem. But I do understand that for very, very, very young children, it could be beneficial. And then the same thing, as you guys said, Yeah, I'm not, if there was some sort of guarantee that the information could not be used by companies in like, any way at all, then I would be much, much more enthusiastic. But I'm just very skeptical about that fact, that it either is if it's developed by the government or anything like that, it's probably gonna be very expensive. It's quite a private group that I'm sort of concerned about where the information is going to go. So in general, I'm, I'm more skeptical this one than the other two, just because I think the information could be used to be used just to, you know, learn more about children, and then try to make them buy products in the future.",feasibility;impactfulness;influentiality
03:24,CS,"Yeah, actually, that's actually I actually, that's the word I think that was on top of my tongue, just skeptical. I guess me I don't like skeptical and a bit like a citizen. Like, it's like one of those. I felt reading it. It's like, like, I maybe I know, it's more academic, but I thought I couldn't help thinking it's like a YouTube ad. It's like, oh, use this toy, you know, help your children but help children in the future, too. And I thought about, like, 23andme how they're like, Oh, you can just pay $50. And you can find out everything about your genetic history, and we can help you others and data, I'm like, oh, but you're a private company. And you're, the data is going to be used for profit. It's not altruistic. So I'm, yeah, I'm skeptical of the data collection. Like, again, like, if it was a really high tech toy, like, like it could machine learn. The patterns of child is giving off on the device, and then I'll put that in a phrase without identifying the child. That would probably be would be really expensive. And I don't know if that would even be feasible. Yeah, ai ai toys like, um, I, like I've seen a couple of them. They've all kind of flopped. But they all had some machine learning to it. But yeah, again, like I think, I think what HS said like I Think hours on the toy would not compare to even, maybe 10 minutes with another child online, even through zoom. So I know what the cost benefit would be. Again,",feasibility;relationality
05:13,HS,"I think if it's made by a company, it'll probably be cheaper. But the condition is probably that they're going to use the information. Even if it's anonymous, I don't think that really matters about the identity all that much, because they're still going to use the data to sell products, because that's the only way they can make money off data is either what they sell the data to researchers, which I don't know how much money that would be worth, actually, but probably not enough to cover even a fraction of the cost, especially within the current because making things robotically now is really expensive. So you're making something that's going to interact with a child. And it's not going to be cheap. And so they're probably going to want to get everything they can out of it by using the data to sell products. So I'm pretty skeptical about this one, probably better places to put funding, in my opinion.",influentiality;privacy
06:05,MCS,"So I will just add in what I thought I also thought that this one like, I ranked this the lowest because yeah, their goals and objectives aren't quite clear. For me, I don't understand why they need to use a toy. Doesn't make sense. And my first question for them would be how, like, what kind of data? Are you gathering? Obviously, they're collecting waste data, but it says that they're also collecting play patterns. Is that like, how are they even trying to collect that using voice? Like, what other sorts of data are they gonna collect? And I think feasibility wise, it's quite hard to on like, for an AI right now, it's quite hard to do social and emotional learning, especially for kids like AIs are having trouble with adults. How are they going to do it for kids?",influentiality;privacy;feasibility
07:03,CS,"Well, that's actually a really good point. Yeah. Yeah, like if our best, like, I know, it's totally my first I was like, Oh, if an AI can't get past capture, like, how's it gonna? How's it going to machine learn? And separase? I just learned to have a it's like a treat and price like, yeah, how does it recognize those kinds of emotional patterns and children? Yeah, it's interesting. Yeah.",feasibility
07:36,MCS,"Yeah. So other than that, I think. Yeah, like overall, I think is a pretty creepy idea to have smart toys. I don't think parents would like to have. It's just creepy. Overall",influentiality
07:51,HS,We all agree that this one is our lowest ranking.,
07:56,CS,"Yeah, I could be like, I actually. Yeah, actually, I have concerns about the second one. But yeah, it's definitely not. It's definitely not going to be my first Definitely not. Okay, yeah, we could do the second one. Is that okay?",
08:11,HS,Yep. That's great.,
08:14,CS,So the second one is the EEG sensors. Yes. Anybody having thoughts on this?,
08:29,HS,"I also, I thought this one was less nefarious than the first one potentially. Yeah, for sure. I thought that it wasn't a particularly good idea. Because I think the solution is, like, you're dealing with people or dealing with children who have lived a very traumatic childhood, maybe not had a chance to interact with children in a positive way, the best way to the best solution is, you know, they come to a new country, and they get to interact with children again, like and with the caring teacher and, and make friends and all that stuff. I just think that's infinitely more valuable than, you know, sort of trying to treat their condition or it's like their conduct. We all know why they've become like, the main reason they become this way and have some sort of, like, you know, mental illness or something, in which case that can be treated separately. But I think the main main thing is that they should be trying to have them interact with with other people again, and try to, you know, show them the more positive side of the world. I don't think that the technological solution is the best one here unless there's, they're really really, you know, have really like basically PTSD level symptoms, in which case that potentially could be useful. I'm not sure how useful it is in treating PTSD, but for most, I think it would be better to just put them into a school as fast as possible. Have them learn alongside other kids.",influentiality;technical
10:10,MCS,"So I think I rank this one as number two. Ah, and my question for them is, maybe it's just that I didn't read the abstract, but they are going to use EEG sensors to assess the language ability reactions to facial stimuli, facial emotions, okay. But then they are saying that they want to foster growth in their cognitive skills. It's so it's unclear for me how they are going to do that using the data that they're collecting and the deep learning models? Like how are they going to use it for growth?",clarity;feasibility
10:55,HS,"Yeah, I understand. It makes sense. Yeah, I don't think the main issue is really whether they're, like, how much they could increase their cognitive ability, like they should kind of focus on, you know, improving them or not improving, but like helping them get through what they've been through and through fostering a love of learning. Again, if that's something that's died out, because of the traumatic situations they've been in.",
11:29,CS,"And when I was reading this, I actually, I immediately ranked it last in my mind. Have you ever done Have you guys ever done like a, like a brain? EEG sensor kind of thing? Like where you put a cap on your head? Yeah, I have not. I've done like two, one for the psychology study, and then one for computer science. The one that wasn't for psychology was more radical. It's a horrible experience. Like, I didn't I like my hair, you didn't have to use a lot of wet cold gel. And it was really uncomfortable. And it felt very alienating. And it was, I was like, Oh, I would never put a kid through that. And then I think the case that case study that they were trying to was children who are displaced or refugee children. Yeah, refugee children. Um, like, this is the last place you want. Like, it really feels like you're putting them through like a like a rat maze. Like I had, I had a really bad experience. And I don't know how they like maybe they could put in like actors and people who are very nice, but like, it was an overall very horrible experience for me. Just doing the sense head cap sensor. So that's why it was a big. Yeah, a big thing for me, like, even with, like, for me, in my mind, like, oh, at least the toys should be soft and cuddly and squeezable and huggable. And this thing is like you're, you're in a chair for a really long time. And it takes a long time to calibrate. And it's it's overall really uncomfortable.",influentiality;relationality
13:14,HS,"I, I assumed for this one, I think this is why I ranked it higher than the toy, I assume for this one, that they would have it set up so that at any point the child could just leave, right, yeah, that's not part of it, then this one is just completely unfeasible because of the trial is like this is too much. They have to be able to just like, leave, and then they have to be able to come back. And if there's if they require a lot of people to make it work, then it's also dead, because it's just, it's not worth the effort. You might as well have those people just teaching the children like normally, as opposed to, I think this the only way this makes any sense is if it's something that the child can literally put, you know, just do it themselves and have it really friendly and simple and easy. And take, like, no time I think if it's done by actual people, it doesn't make any sense because it's",feasibility;impactfulness;influentiality
14:06,CS,"I think the closest thing I could think if it was like a less intrusive one like that Yoda. Do you guys know that Yoda Star Wars toy? Like you put the head cap on? And then you try to relax your - I think it's the same thing. It's at Science World too, they have that little ball that you can move with your, with your mind. So if it was something like that, then I guess I could get behind that. But",influentiality;relationality
14:26,HS,"It was like, like, you would put like maybe a band on your head or you put something on your head and you touch something and you would that you could do it yourself right that it was something that child could optionally do, and that could help them as opposed to something that they're like, you know, they now have to do as part of their recovery. Right? Which I don't think is that good an idea given? Yeah, especially if it's anything like what you if it's any feels like a lab or feels like going to the doctor's office. I don't think it's a good idea. Good way, I think it has to be sort of friendly to kids.",influentiality
15:03,MCS,"So I have actually done research with EEG sensors on seniors and seniors are okay to sit in a chair and be put on a..under the headband, but I mean the cap, what the children I think, yeah, therefore, you will want to use like less intrusive EEG sensors, which are getting produced right now. Like, it's not the the cap type anymore. It's kind of like the band, I think, a headband. So I'm not too concerned with that EEG sensor and their experiences. But yeah, for sure. I think our question can be like, how are they gonna reduce the stress for the kids? And this study?",feasibility;technical
15:47,SC,"Yeah, I think that's a good question. I actually liked like, just because I didn't have the experience with EEGs actually like that it was more objective and like, analyzing, like conversations, or like videos for the first one.",influentiality
16:06,MCS,So I think we need to move on to the next one. Do we have the flaw in the way of the pros and cons here?,instructional
16:16,HS,"For this one, so which things do we have to have? In what way is the structure for pros and cons? You just write them out? It's fine. Yeah. Okay, so feels less?",
16:30,CS,"Yeah. Oh, yeah, I've been just reading on the second page. The third one, I don't know, like this kind of like, jumped at me is like the best one. But it big. Like, for me, it seemed like, very achievable. And had a direct, positive benefit for children who need cheap and easy vision screening to get them connected to a doctor. That's just that was just my first thought.",feasibility
17:06,MCS,"This one was definitely the best one. I thought, like, this was my rank one, two.",
17:14,HS,"Yeah, this is definitely my rank one, just because I feel like it's a little it's it's not it doesn't have potential for nefariousness. And we're the first one does. And then the second one, I have some concerns about this one is sort of, I don't think there's sort of another better solution, because I feel that for the second one, that the children would benefit more from, like, just going to school and, and interacting with people and sort of maybe helping them with dealing with a stressful environment that had been in before, whereas this one is just you know, you're trying to find a way to save money for in countries where they don't have a lot. And people need vision care. And they don't know whether or not they have any revision issue. And so it's like a cheap way of doing that. So I think it is pretty positive in general, my girlfriend raised a concern that actually for some places, it might actually be too expensive, which like is too much? Oh, because the smartphone, the the smartphone is, I think the smartphone is actually too much to, yeah, for a lot of places, it's actually too expensive. So it's sort of like we read this is a great solution for some places now. And most of the work pretty much the whole world in maybe 5-10 years or something. But yeah, there are a lot of places that people don't have a smartphone. And especially not, especially kids do not have a foreign phone, it's sort of like a luxury of people who actually need to have smartphones. So yeah, I don't think this is for every part of the world, but for developing countries that are somewhat wealthy, I think it is, it is good because it is it is cheaper than having to take your files to an optician. So",influentiality;relationality
19:10,MCS,"my main concern for this was the visibility. Like I have also seen other people try to like scan the cornea of the eye like are they doing something like that? And are they like gonna scan the eye and try to figure out like, like, essentially like is how accurate is this system? Is this screening?",clarity;feasibility
19:34,HS,"Yeah, that is a concern. Yeah. I don't know how how good this technology is. Does anyone didn't want to see in the survey any sort of like discussion of how effective the technology is or now don't remember",feasibility;impactfulness;influentiality
19:52,SC,"I was just reading the discussion. It just says like, it doesn't say like, accuracy, but it's like just making sure recruiting is like unbiased, but doesn't say like how it's going to be unbiased.",clarity;feasibility
20:03,HS,"Like, I would worry that if it's not very accurate, then it's just not going to get used because you like you'd get as you did as a parent, you would get the alert, right that your, your child needed something you were needed. There their, their had some issues with their eyes, and then they would have to do something about it. That's not accurate. And it's sort of a waste of time. Like you're,",feasibility;impactfulness
20:27,SC,"Yeah, also, if it's like a minor issue, but then like, all the alerts pop up, and you might end up getting more treatment than you actually need. Which",influentiality
20:34,HS,"Yeah, that's another worry that people are going to, especially in parts of the world where they, where they generally have to pay for things out of their own pocket, they don't want things that are absolutely essential that you'd have to you know, okay, well, my child absolutely needs classes. But they don't, and are, then they have to pay out of pocket, right? And countries really expensive in comparison to what they make. Okay. Okay, do you guys have a ranking that you guys be? I would rank the first one worse? And the second one higher, but I don't think either of them are good idea. And then third, I would rank as my top one. But I am. I am very skeptical about it. Especially have to set the thing about how accurate it is. That is I sort of I should know, I should have thought about that originally. Because it's sort of like you have these advanced systems. And when you go into the eye doctor, and then your phone is going to look at your eyes and determine whether or not it's sort of I don't know, I'm not sure about either of them now.",influentiality
22:07,Host,"Sorry to interrupt, I just came back. Do you need a little bit more time? It sounds like you might need a little bit more time.",
22:14,CS,"Oh, I think yeah, we just did the ranking. And then I think we're good to go. But I so I would put my ranking down as 3,1,2 with three being the best. Does anybody have any other?",instructional
22:38,MCS,"3,2,1 Yeah. Well one and two are kind of the same level.",
22:50,CS,"How about you, SC, what do you think? What would your ranking be?",
22:54,SC,"2,3,1.",
22:59,CS,"Okay, so yeah, okay. Interesting.",
23:10,SC,"I just had a question. Like, I feel like, three isn't really doing anything new, because like people, like, like, we don't really need AI to do it. Whereas like, one. Like, I get that the privacy is there. But I think the like, the idea is good, like, because we know how much like the formal learning opportunities are missed with like people, but that's just like my own thought. Yeah.",clarity
23:36,CS,"Yeah, I think that's yeah, I think that's a totally valid like, like, like it's not trying to push the boundary as much as the other ones. Or let's have work. Oh, innovative. Yeah. And others. We I think, I think we might be deadlocked. Yeah,",
24:00:00,SC,"I mean, I think three, everyone three first, and everyone put one, like most people, so I feel like that's would be our consensus. So it's like three, two, one.",
24:12:00,CS,"Just, I just put all our answers down. Yeah.",
24:19:00,Host,"Yeah, cuz you need to have one answer.",
24:21:00,CS,"Oh, okay. I, I still pick. I could, I could put the scale on this. 3,2,1. Would you guys be okay with that?",
24:35:00,HS,I think we're closest to what it is.,
24:38:00,CS,I'll put final.,
24:40:00,HS,I'm sure we get to discuss our disagreements with where things are to go.,
24:49:00,CS,"See, okay, I think it's I think that's everything. There's at least one question for each one. We agreed on the ranking",
25:00:00,SC,"Yes, thank you for reading.",
25:03:00,Host,"Okay, thanks, everyone. So I don't know why I put welcome back, but welcome back. Can I get somebody that was not the note taker to just report back on your decision? So basically just what proposal did you decide on to win the grant, and also the reason for that, and also to read out the questions",
25:28:00,HS,"I'm sorry, just want me to read the pros and cons we had in the question or",
25:33:00,Host,which one one? Your reasoning? And then what were the three questions you came up with?,
25:38:00,HS,"Okay. Um, so number three, one. Because we had concerns about number one, and privacy, that was a big concern. And then number two, we had concerns about like, EEG, how it how easy it would be for kids to use and whether that would be beneficial. Then number three was sort of it was less expensive, and didn't seem to have any sort of nefarious potential, like the first one. And in the course of the question we had about number one was, what specific data are you trying to collect, infer? And then the other thing was, this sort of seems like a very broad net cast to collect such emotional data. So it's potential for collecting just broad scale data for a specific purpose. And for question for proposal. Number two was EEG sensor data to measure language and sensory reaction seems unclear how the researchers are going to measure growth via deep learning models. What is the exact mechanism you're trying to achieve? And how will it improve the child's cognitive abilities? And then for number three was how accurate is it compared to medical grade equipment? And what are the tech requirements?",feasibility;technical;clarity;privacy;impactfulness;influentiality
27:06:00,Host,"Okay, great. Um, so that is recorded for now. So thank you to everybody, for participating and for your time.",
