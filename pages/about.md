# About {{site.title}}

This project is created using The Oral History as Data (OHD) tool, a static website generator that allows users to analyze and publish coded oral history or qualitative interview files. By turning transcriptions into tagged/coded CSV files, adding a list of filters, and creating a simple markdown file for each interview (to be included in the _transcripts collection), OHD will provide filterable transcripts and a color coded visualization for all transcripts included. 

In the transcripts you will notice abbreviations used in place of speaker names. These are abbreviations for the speaker's academic background. Below is a summary of abbreviations:

ID: Interaction Design

FA: Fine Arts

CS: Undergraduate Computer Science 

MCS: Master's of Computer Science

CM: Children's Literature, Media, and Culture

CSA: Computer Science & Arts Combined Degree

ED: Education

GG: Geography and GIS

HS: History

MD: Medicine

PH: Pharmaceutical Science

SC: Undergraduate Science
